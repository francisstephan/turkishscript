# turkscript

An easy way to use your western latin keyboard to type in turkish alphabet.

Developed with Dart + Angular (Angulardart)

## Usage

Refer to the table of correspondence to type the desired chars. Any characters outside of the table are rendered unchanged.

After a time this will become quite natural, and you will no longer need to refer to the tables.
